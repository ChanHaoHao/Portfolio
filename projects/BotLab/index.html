            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved developing a fully autonomous differential-drive robot capable of navigating and mapping unknown environments. We implemented a control and navigation stack featuring PID control, gyrodometry-based odometry, and Pure Pursuit for smooth motion execution. For localization and mapping, we utilized a particle filter-based SLAM system operating in real time with approximately 6000 particles, achieving a localization RMS error of 3.25 cm. A* path planning and frontier exploration enabled the robot to autonomously explore and construct maps, successfully completing two industry-inspired challenges.</p>

<h1 id="header-1">Motion Control and Odometry</h1>
<p>We began by calibrating the MBot's wheel speed controllers and tuning a PID system to achieve smooth and accurate motion. To enhance odometry, we implemented gyrodometry, a fusion technique that combines encoder data with IMU angular velocity estimates. We also replaced the default motion controller with a Pure Pursuit algorithm, which allowed the robot to follow trajectories with significantly higher precision. This setup laid the foundation for reliable low-level control, enabling consistent trajectory execution across different tasks and environments.</p>

<h1 id="header-2">SLAM and Localization</h1>
<p>A major component of the project was implementing a particle filter-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system. Using LiDAR data, we constructed occupancy grid maps and tracked the robot’s position in real time with over 6,000 particles running at 10 Hz. Our localization approach included both odometry-based motion models and sensor models using beam and likelihood field approaches. The beam model, though computationally heavier, proved to be more accurate. The system achieved a mapping RMSE of just 3.25 cm, demonstrating its precision and reliability. The robot could also handle random initialization in a known map, by distributing particles across the map and refining them through iterative resampling.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="header-3">Autonomous Path Planning and Exploration</h1>
<p>We implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm to allow the robot to navigate known environments. For exploration, we developed a frontier-based system that identifies unexplored regions in the map and plans paths toward them. A timing threshold was introduced to prevent excessive path switching, resulting in more complete and efficient exploration.</p>

<h1 id="header-4">Competition Events and Final Performance</h1>
<p>Our system was evaluated through three competition events, where we achieved <strong>first place overall</strong>. The first event involved autonomous mapping of a convex maze followed by a precise return to the starting position. In the second round of this event, the MBot was required to complete the same route as quickly as possible. With our well-tuned SLAM system and motion controllers, the robot demonstrated both accuracy and speed, completing the challenges with minimal error.</p>
<p>The second event focused on integrating real-time SLAM with object detection. While mapping the environment, the MBot detected and localized colored cones using a vision pipeline. After the mapping phase, the robot was randomly placed within the environment and tasked with visiting each cone in rainbow order before returning to its original starting location. To ensure correct cone positioning, we implemented multithreading to perform cone detection and receive the MBot’s pose via LCM in parallel. Without multithreading, delays in detection could cause pose desynchronization, leading to inaccurate localization of cones.</p>
<p>The third event introduced a manipulation challenge involving a front-mounted forklift. The MBot had to detect crates marked with AprilTags, align itself accurately, insert the forks, and transport crates to designated unloading zones. This task also required multithread, allowing the AprilTag detection process and pose retrieval from LCM to run simultaneously. This ensured precise pose alignment at the moment of detection—critical for successful crate interaction. The event demonstrated our system’s seamless integration of perception, planning, localization, and actuation in a physically interactive task.</p>

<h1 id="header-5">Outcomes and Reflections</h1>
<p>This project delivered a complete robotics solution involving vision, calibration, planning, and actuation. It highlighted the challenges of real-world robotic deployment, such as sensor misalignment and mechanical constraints, and offered a platform to test and validate solutions under task-oriented constraints. Our work reflects strong system integration skills and the ability to balance algorithmic complexity with practical robustness in a dynamic robotic environment.</p>
