            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project involved developing a fully autonomous differential-drive robot capable of navigating and mapping unknown environments. We implemented a control and navigation stack featuring PID control, gyrodometry-based odometry, and Pure Pursuit for smooth motion execution. For localization and mapping, we utilized a particle filter-based SLAM system operating in real time with approximately 6000 particles, achieving a localization RMS error of 3.25 cm. A* path planning and frontier exploration enabled the robot to autonomously explore and construct maps, successfully completing two industry-inspired challenges.</p>

<h1 id="header-1">Motion Control and Odometry</h1>
<p>We began by calibrating the MBot's wheel speed controllers and tuning a PID system to achieve smooth and accurate motion. To enhance odometry, we implemented gyrodometry, a fusion technique that combines encoder data with IMU angular velocity estimates. We also replaced the default motion controller with a Pure Pursuit algorithm, which allowed the robot to follow trajectories with significantly higher precision. This setup laid the foundation for reliable low-level control, enabling consistent trajectory execution across different tasks and environments.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="header-2">SLAM and Localization</h1>
<p>A major component of the project was implementing a particle filter-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system. Using LiDAR data, we constructed occupancy grid maps and tracked the robot’s position in real time with over 6,000 particles running at 10 Hz. Our localization approach included both odometry-based motion models and sensor models using beam and likelihood field approaches. The beam model, though computationally heavier, proved to be more accurate. The system achieved a mapping RMSE of just 3.25 cm, demonstrating its precision and reliability. The robot could also handle random initialization in a known map, by distributing particles across the map and refining them through iterative resampling.</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px">The left image shows Apriltag detections on the workspace. The middle image displays the original camera view before applying homography, where the workspace appears trapezoidal. The right image presents the view after the homography transformation, which corrects the perspective and renders the workspace as a proper rectangle.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="header-3">Autonomous Path Planning and Exploration</h1>
<p>We implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm to allow the robot to navigate known environments. For exploration, we developed a frontier-based system that identifies unexplored regions in the map and plans paths toward them. A timing threshold was introduced to prevent excessive path switching, resulting in more complete and efficient exploration.</p>

<h1 id="header-4">Competition Events and Final Performance</h1>
<p>Our system was evaluated through three competition events, in which we achieved <strong>first place</strong> overall. The first event required the MBot to autonomously map a convex maze and return to its starting position with high precision; in the second round of this event, the robot had to run around the maze as quickly as possible. The second event combined SLAM with real-time object detection, where the MBot had to detect and localize colored cones while mapping the environment. After completing the map, the robot was randomly placed within it and tasked with navigating to each cone in rainbow order before returning to its original mapping start point. The third event introduced a manipulation challenge involving a front-mounted forklift. The MBot had to detect crates marked with AprilTags, align itself accurately, insert the forks, and unload the crates into designated drop-off zones. This task demonstrated our system’s full-stack integration of perception, localization, planning, and actuation—culminating in a top performance across all challenges.</p>

<h1 id="header-5">Outcomes and Reflections</h1>
<p>This project delivered a complete robotics solution involving vision, calibration, planning, and actuation. It highlighted the challenges of real-world robotic deployment, such as sensor misalignment and mechanical constraints, and offered a platform to test and validate solutions under task-oriented constraints. Our work reflects strong system integration skills and the ability to balance algorithmic complexity with practical robustness in a dynamic robotic environment.</p>
